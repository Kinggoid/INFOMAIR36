# Restaurant recommendation dialog system (Group 36)

This file contains a restaurant recommendation dialog system. It is split up into three separate tabs containing the 
requirements for assignment 1A, 1B and 1C.

## Installation

The project requires Python 3.x.

This project uses the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- random (standard library)
- re (standard library)
- Levenshtein
- sys (standard library)
- os (standard library)
- pickle (standard library)

First, clone the repository to local computer:
git clone https://github.com/Kinggoid/INFOMAIR36.git

Then set up a virtual environment and install the required packages (as specified above).

To run the code from assignment_1a, run the "main_1a.py" file. 

To run the code from assignment_1b, run the "main_1b.py" file. Here, a dialog exchange between you and the system will 
begin. The system will try and find a restaurant that fullfills your specifications.

To run the code from assignment_1c, run the "main_1c.py" file. First, you will have to give the system your 
configuration preferences. Then, a dialog exchange between you and the system will begin. The system will try and find 
a restaurant that fullfills your specifications. You can restart the system at any time by typing "restart".
